In september 2019. a great MIT's movement, to open their doors to the
whole world, has come to the field of Data Science. Anyone from the EdX
platform for online learning, showing interests for Data Science has
gotten an invitation to join. In the next year or so, the future
students were asked to pass 4 MIT exams and one Capstone exam, so they
could get the MIT's credentials in Data Science area. If they achieve
the goal, they could also apply for the second semester on MIT's campus
and finish \textbf{Masters of Statistics and Data Science} in a hybrid
generation of online and on campus students.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Mastering the foundations of data science, statistics, and machine
learning using programming languages like \textbf{Python} and \textbf{R}
students are prepared for jobs like: Data Scientist, Data Analyst,
Business Intelligence Analyst, Systems Analyst, Data Engineer. More
about the program could be found
\href{https://micromasters.mit.edu/ds/}{\textbf{here}}.

  equivalent probability theory course
\item
  College-level single and multi-variable calculus
\item
  Vectors and matrices
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Representation, over-fitting, regularization, generalization, VC
  dimension
\item
  Clustering, classification, recommender problems, probabilistic
  modeling, reinforcement learning
\item
  On-line algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks/deep
  learning
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

basic overview of:

\item
  \textbf{vectors} in n-dimensional space (addition and subtraction of
  two vectors, norm of an vector, dot product of two vectors)
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{plane definition} in n-dimensional spaces (used later in
  classification for decision boundary) as: a point \(x\) of
  n-dimensional space belongs to some plane if it satisfies the equation
  \(\theta \cdot x + \theta_{0} = 0\), where \(\theta\) is a vector
  perpendicular to that plane and \(\theta_{0}\) an offset of the plane
  from it's origin.
\item
  loss Function, gradient descent and chain rule
