# My-work-with-data
All of my work, everything that I have learned in R, Python and much more
is here at one place for you to see.
My journey from being a teacher of mathematics and mom of two to being 
experienced with data analysis, machine learning, statistical inference
and data visualization is presented here.

Thank you for following my work!

Wish you a plasent life! Katica
